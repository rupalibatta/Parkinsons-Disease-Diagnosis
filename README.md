# parkinsons-disease-diagnosis

**Inspiration** Parkinson's Disease affects the lives of many individuals and their family members. One of our team member's grandfather's suffered from Parkinson's Disease that was caught in late stages. Symptoms can be caught early but many people don't have access to a simple way of gauging the severity of their symptoms. An app like PDCheck would help everyone gain the access they need to proper diagnostics.

**How does PDCheck work** PD is a scalable way for individuals and caregivers to test the presence of Parkinson's Disease symptoms. It does this by providing people who may have or already have Parkinson's Disease with a user-friendly version of the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). PDCheck also addresses the motor examination aspects of the test. Due to time constraints, right now we can test an individual's speech for symptoms using a Parkinson's speech dataset.

**How we built it** Back-End: Built in with TensorFlow, Numpy, and Keras UX Design: Designed and prototyped using Figma. Inspiration for color choice and user flow came from other health apps on the market.

**What's next for PDCheck** We plan to complete the prototype and use React Native to create the real interface of the app. We also hope to reach out to doctors and organizations that would benefit from this app. Lastly, it would be wonderful to expand this app's capabilities. So far we've implemented one use case, Parkinson's, but this app could easily be added onto to include questionnaires/tests for other diseases.
